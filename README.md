🚀 Excited to share my latest Project on KPI Analysis!

The Project built using Power BI, Python, SQL, and Excel. This project was designed to transform raw HR and business data into meaningful insights for better decision-making.

🔹 The project started with data collection and cleaning using Python (Pandas, Numpy) and Excel to handle missing values, outliers, and formatting issues.

🔹 I used SQL for querying, filtering, and transforming data, ensuring a structured format for reporting and analysis.

🔹 The cleaned dataset was then integrated into Power BI, where I built multiple interactive dashboards.

✨ Key Features of the Dashboard:

✔ KPI Analysis Page – Showcasing key metrics like Employee Count, Standard Hours, Salary Hike, Stock Options, and Years at Company.

✔ Regional Sales Analysis Page – Providing insights into attrition, daily rates, standard hours, and years at company across different business travel categories.

✔ Vendor Associated Analysis Page – Highlighting trends in stock option levels, daily rates by department, and years with current manager.

✔ Interactive Slicers & Filters – Added for Department, Gender, Education, Job Role, and Daily Rate, allowing stakeholders to drill down into specific data.

✔ Page Navigation Concept – Created smooth transitions between different dashboards, improving the overall user experience.

✔ Attrition & Gender Analysis – Designed visuals to compare employee retention trends and demographic distributions.

🔹 The visuals included bar charts, line charts, KPI cards, and tables for detailed and high-level analysis.

🔹 Business travel trends were analyzed to understand employee engagement and tenure patterns.

🔹 Salary hike and compensation insights were integrated to help evaluate workforce retention strategies.

🔹 Vendor and departmental analysis helped in identifying areas of resource allocation and workforce distribution.

🔹 The project emphasizes data storytelling by presenting complex datasets in an intuitive and easy-to-understand way.

🛠 Tech Stack Used:

🐍 Python → Data cleaning & preprocessing

🗄 SQL → Querying & transformation

📑Excel → Initial data validation

📊 Power BI → Dashboarding, visualization & insights

📈 Key Insights:

•Total employee count: 1,470

•Average years at company: 10K (Sum)

•Standard hours total: 118K

•Salary hike percentage: 22K (Sum)

•Business travel employees have longer tenure compared to non-travel employees.

💡 This project helped me strengthen my skills in data analysis, visualization, and business intelligence, and it demonstrates how raw data can be transformed into actionable insights that drive business growth.
